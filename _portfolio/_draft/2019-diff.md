We consider the problem of computing the differences between two music scores, given in XML encoding ([MusicXML](https://www.musicxml.com/) or [MEI](https://music-encoding.org/)), and visualise these differences side-to-side.

Our initial goal was to implement for digital music scores a utility similar to the Unix diff command for text files. Its purposes are twofold: 

- first to identify the differences between the two score files, that which are relatively similar (typically two versions of the same file), following an intuitive notion of difference;
  straightforward applications are version control systems and collaborative music score edition;
- second, to compute a distance between the files, that can be used for training and validation purposes in applications such as Optical Music Recognition.

We are developing several approaches (see systems description [here](soft/2019-scorediff)). In all approaches, the comparison is performed at the granularity level of measures (bars), which are the analagous, for music scores, of lines of text files. More precisely, in a first step, we compute a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of bars in the two files. Then, the second step is a comparison at the granularity level of notes or chords in side bars (the analogous of characters in text files), based on dedicated combinations of edit-distances between strings and trees applied to abstract Intermediate Representation (IR) of score content used for disambiguation and decoupling comparison from the concrete file encoding. 

In a first approach presented in this [paper](publication/2019-11-01-A-diff-procedure-for-music-score-files) and this [demo](publication/2019-11-01-Computation-and-Visualization-of-Differences-between-two-XML-Music-Score-Files), we use an IR close to the model of the toolkit [Music21](https://www.music21.org) (itself close to [MusicXML](https://www.musicxml.com) documents structures).

In a more recent approach in development, we use the same [Tree Score Model](portfolio/2024-TSM/) that we are using for transcription.
