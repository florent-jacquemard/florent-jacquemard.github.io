Abstract:
We present a rhythm transcription system integrated in the computer-assisted composition environment OpenMusic. Rhythm transcription consists in translating a series of dated events into traditional music notation's pulsed and structured representation. As transcription is equivocal, our system favors interactions with the user to reach a satisfactory compromise between various criteria, in particular the precision of the transcription and the readability of the output score. It is based on a uniform approach, using a hierarchical representation of duration notation in the form of rhythm trees, and an efficient dynamic-programming algorithm that lazily evaluates the transcription solutions. It is run through a dedicated user interface allowing to interactively explore the solution set, visualize the solutions and locally edit them.
