abstract:
We present a new approach for the transcription of drum performances captured on a MIDI drum kit into scores in conventional Western notation. It works by parsing an input MIDI sequence into a tree-structured intermediate representation, using formal language techniques, post-processing using term rewriting, and finally exporting into an XML score file in the MEI encoding. An experimentation was conducted on the Groove MIDI Dataset.
