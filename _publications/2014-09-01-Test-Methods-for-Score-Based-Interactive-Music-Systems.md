abstract: 
Score-Based Interactive Music Systems (SBIMS) are involved in live performances with human musicians, reacting in realtime to audio signals and asynchronous incoming events according to a pre-specified timed scenario called a mixed score. This implies strong requirements of reliability and robustness to unforeseen errors in input. In this paper, we present the application of formal methods for black-box conformance testing of embedded systems to SBIMS's. 
We describe how we have handled the 3 main problems in automatic testing reactive and realtime software like SBIMS: 
- (i) the generation of relevant input data for testing, including delay values, with the sake of exhaustiveness, 
- (ii) the computation of the corresponding expected output, according to a given mixed score, 
- (iii) the test execution on input and verdict. 

The results obtained from this formal test method have permitted to identify bugs in the SBIMS Antescofo.
