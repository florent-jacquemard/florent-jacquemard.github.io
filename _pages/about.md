## Research interests
- **Automated Deduction**, in particular Inductive Theorem Proving, and Term Rewriting,
- Theory of **Tree Automata**, **weighted** and unweighted, **constrained** and unconstrained
- **Edit Distances** between strings and trees, 
- Logic for Computer Science.

During last years, my research project has been concerned with Computer Music and Digital Humanities, 
more specifically with the processing of structured written music data (*digital music scores*), 
and in particular the following problems:
- the **creation** and **digitalisation** of music notation (automatic music transcription), 
- Automatic Music **Transcription**
- Digital Music Score and Corpora **analysis** (Digital Musicology),
- **Melodic Similarity** computation
- **Information Retrieval** in collections of digital music scores

Formerly, I have worked on the application of the above formal methods to the verification of systems and software:
- Interactive Music Systems, Real-Time Testing and Computer-Aided Composition at **[Ircam](https://www.ircam.fr)**, Paris (team [Mutant](http://repmus.ircam.fr/mutant)),
- Verification of Web data management systems and computer security at **[LSV](http://www.lsv.fr)/ENS-Cachan**, 
- Automated Deduction and Software Verification at **[Inria Nancy](http://www.loria.fr)**, **[MPI-I](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de)** Saarbrücken, **[SRI International](http://www.csl.sri.com)**, Stanford,
- Development of secure embedded software components for smartcards and payment terminals at the company **Trusted Logic**.

## News
- papers on pitch spelling, the problem of inferring proper note names, 
  in collaboration with Augustin Bouquillard, at 
  [TENOR'24](https://florent-jacquemard.github.io/publication/2024-04-01-Engraving-Oriented-Joint-Estimation-of-Pitch-Spelling-and-Local-and-Global-Keys) and 
  [CMMR'25](https://florent-jacquemard.github.io/publication/2025-11-03-Pitch-Spelling-Jazz-Lead-Sheets-and-Solo-Transcriptions) (Nov. 2025).

- fully automated transcription, with qparse, in [MEI](https://music-encoding.org), of 442 recordings of electronic drum-kits 
  of Google Magenta's [Groove MIDI Dataset](https://magenta.withgoogle.com/datasets/groove), 
  presented at the Music Encoding Conference [MEC'25](https://florent-jacquemard.github.io/publication/2025-06-03-Automated-MEI-Transcription-Dataset-of-Electronic-Drum-Kit-Recordings) in June 2025.
  The transcriptions can be found on  https://github.com/florento/MEI-GMD/

- visit of Masahiko Sakai, in March 2025, in the context of the 
  Japan national project **Kakenhi** on Automatic music transcription based on formal language theory (JSPS Foundation, 2020-2025), 
  involving Sakai Lab at Nagoya University and Tojo Lab at JAIST, Kanazawa. We are a funded external partner of the project.

- final year of the French national project [**CollabScore**](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-20-CE27-0014) (ANR 2020-2025), aiming at the development of approaches for music score digitilization in semi-structured formats, with Optical Music Recognition (OMR) and methods for large scale collaborative correction and the valorization of music collections. It implies [Cedric](https://cedric.cnam.fr)/CNAM (coordinator), Irisa, [IReMus](https://www.iremus.cnrs.fr)/CNRS/SU, the [BnF](https://gallica.bnf.fr/) (French National Library), 2 libraries of [Fondation Royaumont](https://www.royaumont.com/fr/les-bibliotheques), and the company [Antescofo](https://www.antescofo.com).

- end of European H2020-SC6-TRANSFORMATIONS projet [**Polifonia**](http://polifonia-project.eu)  (2021-2024) *a digital harmoniser for musical heritage knowledge*. The objective of the project is to realise an ecosystem of computational methods and tools supporting discovery, extraction, encoding, interlinking, classification, exploration of, and access to, European musical heritage knowledge on the Web, and to demonstrate that these tools improve the state of the art of Social Science and Humanities methodologies. The partners are Alma Mater Studiorum, Università di Bologna (coordinateur), Open University, Stichting Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Insight Centre for Data Analytics, NUI Galway, Istituto Centrale del Catalogo e della Documentazione, Istituto Centrale per i Beni Sonori e Audiovisivi, IReMus/CNRS/SU, Cedric/CNAM, Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, Digital Paths srl.

- final year of the INRIA Exploratory Action [**Codex**](https://project.inria.fr/codex) (2020-2023) on the formal representation and processing of symbolic music data, and applications to information retrieval in digital music score databases, computational musicology, music transcription and corpus digitization. The project is starting in November 2020 with the PhD 
of Lydia Rodriguez de la Nava.
