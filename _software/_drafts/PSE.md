RA 2024:

With Augustin Bouquillard, we revisited the problems of pitch spelling (PS, estimation of note names from their pitch in number of semitones) and local and global tonality guessing with a new algorithm for their joint estimation. It searches for an optimal spelling based on current conventions for music notation, and musicalogical tools such as distances between tonalities. An evaluation conducted on a monophonic and a challenging piano dataset shows a higher degree of accuracy than for current state-of-art system for PS.
