TSM (Tree Score Model) is a C++ library for 
tree-structured representation music score

Several export formats are possible, 
including [MEI](http://music-encoding.org/about/)
and [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org).

The transcription procedure is based on a prior language model 
of musical scores
describing the prefered music notations.
In contrast to other tools using on sequential models (Markov chains), 
our language model (weighted tree automata) is hierarchical,
allowing to take into account 
the deep structure of common Western rhythm notation
(musical meter, rhythms beaming *etc*).
Such languages can be built using several methods, 
in particular they can be learned from corpora, 
for a transcription in a given notational style.
